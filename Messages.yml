# When configuring, you may use single quotes or double quotes, or no quotes at all. 
# I just recommend you use double quotes like so: "text here"
#
# For a list of all placeholders, use the command /mccadmin locale  
# And it'll print out a file with all the information for customizing messages.
#
# Prefix for all messages
# These are represented by $prefix$  and  $error$  respectively.
#
# For placeholders use $arg[number]$ for the index of which command argument you want it to replace.
# For example, a command as such: /help admin FlailoftheLord
#  $arg1$ would return "admin" and $arg2$ would return my name.
# Using $arg0$ will return the command name.
