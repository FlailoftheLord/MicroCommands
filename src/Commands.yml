# Note: the arg options [arg] means optional and <arg> means required. 
# These are just commonly used examples and are not Required, but they're highly recomended,
# just so players know what's required and what's not.
# Also, remember to put a double ' in messages, to let the plugin know that it's a punctuation and not the end of the message.
# use the placeholders  $command$ and $permission$ for their relative objects... 
#   (the name of said command, and the permission node for that command)
